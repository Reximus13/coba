            <h1><span>About me</span></h1>
            <p>Hello my name is Idrus Haikal, you can call me Haikal. I am an Photographer. I started working as a photographer as a hobby and took pictures of various random things that I found interesting But as time went by I started to freelance as a photographer, I tried various types of photography such as travel photography, portrait photography, landscape photography and others. After taking a photo, of course, to improve the results of the photo, editing skills are needed. That's when I also delved into editing, as well as photo editing or video editing And now I can use Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Premiere, etc.  </p>
